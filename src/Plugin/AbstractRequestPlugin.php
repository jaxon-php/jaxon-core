/**
 * AbstractRequestPlugin.php - Jaxon Request interface
 *
 * Interface for Jaxon Request plugins.
 *
 * Request plugins handle the registration, client script generation and processing of jaxon enabled requests.
 * Each plugin should have a unique signature for both the registration and processing of requests.
 * During registration, the user will specify a type which will allow the plugin to detect and handle it.
 * During client script generation, the plugin will generate a <jaxon.request> stub with the prescribed call options and request signature.
 * During request processing, the plugin will detect the signature generated previously and process the request accordingly.
